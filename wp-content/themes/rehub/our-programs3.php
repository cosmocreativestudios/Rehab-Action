				<h5>About Program</h5>
				<p>Throughout the individually determined length of stay that you or your loved one spends at our RTC program, we not only assure that you achieve supervised time abstinent from mind-altering substances, but we'll give you or your loved one the tools needed for a lifetime of sobriety. <br>
				You and your loved one can expect to work with some of the brightest minds and leading experts in the field as we hand pick all of our staff from a pool of qualified candidates. Since we value our people as our number one asset, each member of our Treatment Team is interviewed by the Director of the Program, as well as our Founder, Cary Quashen, before joining our respected team. </p>

						<h4>Admission Process</h4>
						<div class="op3-accordion-content">
							<p>Upon admission to our residential facilities, you or your loved one will be assessed by our clinical Treatment Team—the first step towards creating a personalized treatment program geared towards addressing the specific needs of each individual. Our team understands that each client is an individual, although it's common that people struggling with addiction and co-occuring disorders have many similarities among one another, regardless of differences such as ethnicity, social status, and even drug or drugs of choice. At the end of the day, we are fighting the same battle: to learn how to live with the disease of addiction, and then to put into action the tools learned to live a healthy, happy, and sober life.  </p>
							<p>The Admission Process continues on as our team introduces you or your loved one to the rest of the group, with a warm Welcome Group. We understand that everything is going to be a little scary. We understand our facility is not going to feel like home in the first 5 minutes. So, we've developed a process to make this a little less scary. Our Welcome Group is a simple and subtle yet wonderful and easy way to break the ice with group treatment in general and to establish relationships with peers and our Treatment Team members. </p>
							<p>We emphasize the importance of the group setting because we know that it's nearly impossible, and at times even dangerous, to tackle drug or alcohol addiction alone. After introductions take place, the next step of the admission process is to introduce you or your loved one to their first Group: a simple Welcome Group addressing broad aspects of addiction, and the philosophies and principles that Action's team emphasizes to teach you or your loved one to live a healthy life after prolonged abuse of a substance. </p>
