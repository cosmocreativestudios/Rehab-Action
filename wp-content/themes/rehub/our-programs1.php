				<h5>About the ASLEC Ranch in SCV</h5>
				<p>The Action SCV Sober Living Ranch is designed strictly for adult men who are early in their recovery process from drug and alcohol usage/ abuse. The program is specifically designed to increase the chances of success in recovery as individuals step down from rehab and into Action's Intensive Outpatient Treatment program.</p>
				<p>The Sober Living environment is governed and overseen by incredible Co-Directors with years and years of experience in the management of rehab treatment centers. The Sober Living Ranch also utilizes Action Drug Rehab team members and founder Cary Quashen to provide support and supervision as well as community to the Sober Living Ranch.</p>

				<p>Action’s sober living provides transportation to our SCV Intensive Outpatient Alcohol and Drug treatment program, 3 days per week.  Also, Action provides transportation to the local grocery store once weekly for shopping. Additionally, residents will be offered rides to nearby AA/NA meeting halls several times per week.  This is the only transportation provided; there is a bus stop about a quarter mile down the street if needed for transportation to and from work.</p>

				<p>Food is not provided nor prepared. Residents are required to handle this on their own. Jobs are encouraged, and eventually mandatory. Action's team members are here to help individuals get jobs and get into school. We'll help you sign up for classes, and our managers will look over resumes and provide tips and advice as we are accustomed to reviewing hundreds of resumes for positions at our treatment centers and corporation.</p>

				<p>Behavioral contracts must be signed. The Sober Living has strict, yet reasonable, and success oriented rules that must be followed. Those who follow the rules, and the direction of the program, will greatly increase their chances of obtaining long term sobriety.</p>

				<p>Those signing up for the Action Sober Living Ranch must be willing to step outside of their comfort zones, and integrate successfully back into the community. Residents must want sobriety, and be willing to diligently put in work towards their own sobriety. Guidance and direction will be provided by a House Manager and Action Team Members to give each and every person their best possible chance at success towards reintegration & long term sobriety.</p>

				<p>Action works in collaboration with many partners in the community.  We can help individuals get jobs and fill out employment applications. We also help people with educational enrollment into GED programs, & local colleges including College of the Canyons which offers associates degrees and bachelor degrees, as well as online classes.</p>

				<p>Action’s Sober Living program is highly structured, yet not intensive. It is focused towards success, sobriety, happiness, & reintegration into the community.</p>
