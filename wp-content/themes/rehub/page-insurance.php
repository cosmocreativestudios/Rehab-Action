				<h5>Getting Help for Addiction</h5>
				<h2>Will My Policy Cover The Cost of Treatment?</h2>
				<p>If you’ve recently decided to seek treatment for addiction, you’ll be delighted to know that insurance covers certain aspects of rehab. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) obligates all marketplace insurance plans, Medicaid plans and private insurance policies to cover health benefits such as emergency services, vision care, lab tests, pediatric care and mental health conditions. Substance abuse disorders fall into the mental health category, and therefore some level of treatment must be covered by your insurance plan.</p>
